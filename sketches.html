        wasnt even sunflowers<br>
        but the color so vivid<br>
        like sun, flowers that<br>
        bloom<br>
        everytime i remember<br>
        like an overblown flim<br>
        on a ruined occasion because of too much<br>
        too much light too much voice<br>
        and in silence stands my<br>
        shattered heart that<br>
        blooms everytime i remember her smile<br>
        <br>
        theres an unwanted visitor<br>
        that quietly reminds me<br>
        of all of my missteps as they<br>
        tear of my skin<br>
        they echo as hallways<br>
        shift and close in<br>
        to ensure my position<br>
        as unfullfilled/incomplete dignitary<br>
        <br>
        shoot<br>
        like a question waiting for days and<br>
        shoot<br>
        like a cascade of images forced into form and<br>
        shoot<br>
        like performative frustration made identity for the masses and<br>
        shoot<br>
        like a depressed rockstar that never made 30 but dont<br>
        shoot<br>
        the phonecall that told you how they<br>
        shot<br>
        them down on the way to the stars and<br>
        pray<br>
        they made it up there anyway or<br>
        shoot<br>
        because how could we accept what has happened without going down shooting<br>
