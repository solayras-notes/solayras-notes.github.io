        wasnt even sunflowers
        but the color so vivid
        like sun, flowers that
        bloom
        everytime i remember
        like an overblown flim
        on a ruined occasion because of too much
        too much light too much voice
        and in silence stands my
        shattered heart that
        blooms everytime i remember her smile

        theres an unwanted visitor
        that quietly reminds me
        of all of my missteps as they
        tear of my skin
        they echo as hallways
        shift and close in
        to ensure my position
        as unfullfilled/incomplete dignitary

        shoot
        like a question waiting for days and
        shoot
        like a cascade of images forced into form and
        shoot
        like performative frustration made identity for the masses and
        shoot
        like a depressed rockstar that never made 30 but dont
        shoot
        the phonecall that told you how they
        shot
        them down on the way to the stars and
        pray
        they made it up there anyway or
        shoot
        because how could we accept what has happened without going down shooting
