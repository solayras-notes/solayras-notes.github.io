            <h4>random notes collection</h4>

            wasnt even sunflowers
            but the color so vivid
            like sun, flowers that
            bloom
            everytime i remember
            like an overblown film
            on a ruined occasion because of too much
            too much light too much voice
            and in silence stands my
            shattered heart that
            blooms everytime i remember her smile

            theres an unwanted visitor
            that quietly reminds me
            of all of my missteps as they
            tear of my skin
            they echo as hallways
            shift and close in
            to ensure my position
            as unfullfilled/incomplete dignitary

            shoot
            like a question waiting for days and
            shoot
            like a cascade of images forced into form and
            shoot
            like performative frustration made identity for the masses and
            shoot
            like a depressed rockstar that never made 30 but dont
            shoot
            the phonecall that told you how they
            shot
            them down on the way to the stars and
            pray
            they made it up there anyway or
            shoot
            because how could we accept what has happened without going down shooting

            break through the asphalt
            draw lines in pink color
            mixed blood with the color of the sky
            on a scorching hot summer day
            until nothin but dry skin remains
            scattering like autumn leaves
            above the gaze of a grinning skull
            lying in a field of pink flowers

            speak of my memories as you might speak to the soil
            hushed and in mourning
